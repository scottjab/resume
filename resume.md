### Experience {#experience}
Squarespace (Remote)
: *Tech Lead*
  _June 2019-Aug 2022_
  Started as the Teach Lead for the MongoDB subteam on the Databases team.  The first main task was scaling the large sharded MongoDB clusters. Migrated backups to a snapshot system in GCP, and worked with engineering teams to fix data modeles that did not scale. 
  
  I ended my tenure at Squarespace as the Tech Lead for Data Infrastructure. My team was responsible for all streaming and data processing infrastructure. In a short time we were able to migrate two legacy on-premises aging Hadoop clusters to Dataproc in GCP.  During this migration I worked with many teams to burn down technical debt and migrate many ETLs and reports to offerings based in GCP.

Stripe (Remote)
: *Software Engineer*
  _Apr 2016-Feb 2019_
  Worked with the Storage Team to globally scale out MongoDB, by writing tools to observe how the organization used the database, including code to fingerprint queries to optimize index usage. Also wrote tooling to automate day to day operations on a large set of sharded mongo clusters.  In addition to the MongoDB work, I was in charge of development of Stripe internal open source data warehouse named "Sequins".  This distributed read only key/value store sat at the end of the ETL pipeline at Stripe and stored everything from counts to trained machine learning models. 

Urban Airship (Portland, OR)
: *Lead Operations Engineer (Security)*
  _Mar 2013-Mar 2016_
  Scaled Urban Airship's push notification and analytic platforms though the mobile boom of the early 2010's. Leveraged Kafka to successfully deliver millions of messages a day on real hardware. I built deployment and operations tooling using python, and JVM based languages such as clojure and java.  I was also leading the companies efforts around observability.  I designed and built a distributed scaleable log parsing and analysis system on top of kafka, that was API compatible with the Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana system.

University of Dayton (Dayton, OH)
: *Systems Engineer* 
  _Jul 2006-Mar 2013_
  I was responsible for the University's successful single sign on Identity management project.  This included a single sign on for all university resources.  I also worked on the in house DNS/DHCP self registration system.  Over the years the university transitioned from Netware to Linux to serve file and print services, during this transition I lead the project to move from hand configured nodes to using centralized configuration management with puppet.  This greatly reduced toil for the operators.
